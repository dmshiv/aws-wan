Tf automation script basically what it does ?

✅ Universal Terraform Automation Script - Complete!
What it does:

🔍 Auto-detects any number of Terraform folders
🏗️ Builds infrastructure sequentially (wan → regional folders)
🗑️ Destroys infrastructure intelligently (checks what exists first)
⚡ Shows errors immediately when they happen
🛑 Stops on first failure to prevent cascading issues
🔄 Works regardless of how infrastructure was originally built
